Jove's lightnings, the precursors\\nO' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\\nAnd sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks\\nOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\\nSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\\nYea, his dread trident shake.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nMy brave spirit!\\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\\nWould not infect his reason?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nNot a soul\\nBut felt a fever of the mad and play'd\\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners\\nPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\\nThen all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,\\nWith hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--\\nWas the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty\\nAnd all the devils are here.'\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nWhy that's my spirit!\\nBut was not this nigh shore?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nClose by, my master.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nBut are they, Ariel, safe?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nNot a hair perish'd;\\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\\nBut fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,\\nIn troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.\\nThe king's son have I landed by himself;\\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\\nIn an odd angle of the isle and sitting,\\nHis arms in this sad knot.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nOf the king's ship\\nThe mariners say how thou hast disposed\\nAnd all the rest o' the fleet.\\n\\nARIEL:\\nSafely in harbour\\nIs the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once\\nThou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\\nFrom the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:\\nThe mariners all under hatches stow'd;\\nWho, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,\\nI have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet\\nWhich I dispersed, they all have met again\\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote,\\nBound sadly home for Naples,\\nSupposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd\\nAnd his great person perish.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nAriel, thy charge\\nExactly is perform'd: but there's more work.\\nWhat is the time o' the day?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nPast the mid season.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nAt least two glasses.

Where was she born? speak; tell me.\\n\\nARIEL:\\nSir, in Argier.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nO, was she so? I must\\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\\nWhich thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,\\nFor mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible\\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\\nThou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did\\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nAy, sir.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child\\nAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,\\nAs thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;\\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\\nTo act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,\\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\\nBy help of her more potent ministers\\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\\nImprison'd thou didst painfully remain\\nA dozen years; within which space she died\\nAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans\\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike.

Believe me, sir,\\nIt carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nNo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\\nAs we have, such.
